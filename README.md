### Hi there, 

I am a biologist/paleogeneticist interested in tracing how diversity and organismal composition have changed in the past. 
To accomplish this, I am working with environmental DNA and ancient DNA from (marine) sediment cores and apply DNA metabarcoding or shotgun metagenomics. 
This repository is used to publish the scripts that accompany my publications.
