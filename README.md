### Hi there, I'm Heike ðŸ‘‹

I am a biologist/paleogeneticist interested in tracing how diversity and organismal composition have changed over time and in identifying potential drivers of these changes. 
To accomplish this, I am working with ancient DNA from marine sediment cores and apply DNA metabarcoding or shotgun metagenomics.
